### Background & Motivation

Our group chose to do this project on Flight Delay Analysis because all three of us frequently take flights as a form of travel, as we are not from Massachusetts. Flight delays are a very frustrating and unfortunately, common experience, which made this topic relevant to us personally and thus, more meaningful. Taking a deeper look into the reason and patterns behind delays with flights felt like an interesting and practical way to apply data analysis to a real-world problem we all regularly face. 

This project combines both our personal experiences as well as our drive for data-driven exploration; by examining these patterns in delays, we are eager to gain insights that can hopefully help frequent fliers, such as us, better anticipate delays and plan itineraries that go hand in hand with that.

### Objectives
The goal of our project is to analyze flight delay data to identify common causes of delays based on factors such as location, time, and season. By visualizing this data, we want to answer key questions such as the most frequent reasons for delay, the percentage of delayed flights, any time or seasonal patterns that affect the punctuality of flight arrivals, and most dependable airline. Understanding these factors can help not only help passengers anticipate delays, but also allow airlines to be prepared and mitigate them more effectively. 

Overall, the insights we can gain through analyzing this flight data can help improve flight scheduling within airports, allow for better resource allocation, and enhance customer satisfaction among airlines, all of which contribute to a more efficient travel process.

### Data

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) is a part of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and is the primary source of transportation data for the U.S. government. They collect, analyze, and disseminate data on all modes of transportation. This dataset, known as the “Airline On-Time Performance Data”, encompasses detailed records of scheduled and actual departure and arrival times for non-stop domestic flights reported by certified U.S. air carriers. 

Since June 2003, the airlines that report on-time data also report the causes of delays to BTS. This is available in a publicly accessible interface where users can explore various aviation databases, including the "Airline On-Time Performance Data," to retrieve specific datasets. The raw data can be downloaded in excel sheets, with the option to obtain one month of data at a time.
